## ZOIA tools

Using this repo to dump a bunch of useful tools and resources for ZOIA patch building.

For now, all it contains is a [Markdown version](ZOIA_MODULE_INDEX.md) of the [ZOIA module index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQcGVEhGqASv5cuu5yDjQ2Fy62YUF0L86VwhbU0pxMjq6Lt5dPJl_KIMGIHROeRC-vbO3qqYukHZEDW/pubhtml).

It should be much easier to feed a markdown file like this to an LLM like ChatGPT to get custom LLM-assisted advice on patch building ;-)

Feel free to tweak, adapt the code, or submit PRS to generate other formats. Or report issues -- there's a high chance bugs have sneaked through and the output isn't perfect.
